# How to import works in python.

import math
# print(math.sqrt(20))
# print(math.floor(23.445))
print(dir(math))


# from math import sqrt,pi #imports only perticular mentioned functions
# print(sqrt(9))
# print(pi)
# print(2*pi)

# import UserDefined
# a = 12
# b = 24
# print(f"Addition of {a} + {b} is ",UserDefined.add(a,b))

# from UserDefined import sub
# a = 90
# b = 20
# print(f"Addition of {a} - {b} is ",sub(a,b))

# from UserDefined import sub as s
# a = 90
# b = 20
# print(f"Addition of {a} - {b} is ",s(a,b))
