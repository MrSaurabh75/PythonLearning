                        i.Explicite TypeCasting : The conversion of a data type into another data type by a programmer is known as explicite typecasting
                        ii.Implicite TypeCasting : According to a level one data type is converted to another is known as implicite typecasting. Python converts a smaller datatype into a higher datattype to prevent data loss.

# Example -->
a = "23"
b = int(a)
print(type(b))

c = 12
d = str(c)

x = 3.55
y = 7
print(x+y)
