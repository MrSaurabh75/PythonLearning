# Question --> Create a Calculator which is capabale for performing all mathematical oprations of all oprators

# Answer -->

a = 10
b = 20
print("Addition of ",a," and ",b," is ",a+b)
print("Substration of ",a," and ",b," is ",a-b)
print("Multiplication of ",a," and ",b," is ",a*b)
print("Division of ",a," and ",b," is ",a/b)
print("Floor Division of ",a," and ",b," is ",a//b)
print("Module of ",a," and ",b," is ",a%b)
print("Exponential of ",a," and ",b," is ",a**b)
